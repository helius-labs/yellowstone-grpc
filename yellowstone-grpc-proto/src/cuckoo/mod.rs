//! Compressed account filtering via cuckoo filters.
//!
//! For clients tracking large pubkey sets (100k–millions): instead of re-uploading an
//! explicit pubkey list, the client uploads a compact cuckoo filter (~3 bytes/pubkey at
//! 95% load) and the server matches accounts against it.
//!
//! - [`CompressedAccountFilterSet`] — safe, tracked client-side builder (`convert` feature).
//! - [`CuckooFilter`] — raw filter for server-side matching; has a `remove` footgun, so
//!   clients should prefer [`CompressedAccountFilterSet`].
//!
//! Server-side matching accepts <1% false positives; clients re-check locally with
//! [`CompressedAccountFilterSet::contains`].
